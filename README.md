# Identification-of-Medicinal-Plants
Deep Learning CNN Model used to identify medicinal plants. Implementation of flask framework web application
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution for the identification of medicinal plants using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
Medicinal plants have been used for centuries in traditional medicine, and their identification is essential for various applications, including herbal medicine, pharmacology, and biodiversity conservation. 
By leveraging the power of deep learning, we can create an automated system that assists in the accurate and efficient identification of medicinal plants.
